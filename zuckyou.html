              As the world recovers from the first World War, two siblings write to each other across an ocean of possibilities. Through letters, diary entries, and notes, we are afforded the opportunity to learn about their tumultuous lives as documented in this novel.

              This novel actually began when I wrote the first letter as an assignment for my high school English class. I discovered it again a few years later and decided then and there that I would turn it into an epistolary novel. Progress is slow, as always with my prose, but it's a delight to work on.

              <h5>Summary</h5>
              <i>
                As it turned out, leading a coup was more complicated than simply killing your parents - and much to the princess’s frustration, even that seemed more difficult than she’d anticipated.
              <br><br>
              All she wanted to do was create a better kingdom (well, besides getting a little revenge along the way). But between keeping the territories under her thumb and questioning the loyalties of her advisors, the fight to become the rightful ruler was a treacherous game indeed.

              One of my favorite stories right now, The Princess of Jusan is a historical fiction novel that I've been working on for a few years now. I hope you enjoy reading it!

              Six years ago, Watson and Agnes had a falling out in college. 
              Since then, they've avoided all contact—until a friend from their old mystery club dies. 
              The two suddenly find themselves thrown together after being the recipients of threatening, anonymous emails 
              As they are haunted by old ghosts, two fundamental questions emerge: who is out to get them, and what exactly for?
