          Hi guys! This is just a short post to tell you that 8letters will be at the Manila International Book Fair from September 12-16. Along with their other books, they'll be selling the Summer Dreams anthology for P250. If anyone is planning to go to MIBF, they'll be at booth IP3!
          <br><br>
          Some of you may remember that Summer Dreams was the short story contest I joined a few months ago. I was super lucky to have my story ("I'm. Okay.") chosen as one of the top ten, so I'm SUPER DUPER EXCITED to see my story in print!!! :D

            <h3>Democrazy Live (June 7, 2018)</h3>
             <br>
            <p style="font-size: 14px;">September 2, 2018</p>
             <br>
            <p style="text-align:left;">
            Hi guys! This is a long overdue blog about Democrazy Live, 22 Tango Records' open mic in June. For those of you who don't know, 22 Tango Records is a Cebu-based record label. This year they hosted "Democrazy Live" at Handuraw. They invited artists to perform there every Thursday of June, where their songs would be recorded live. As you may have guessed, I was one of the artists who performed.
            <br><br>
            My friends (the very talented <a href="https://soundcloud.com/robinsparrow">Julia Quijano</a> and <a href="https://soundcloud.com/cristeensalazar">Cristeen Salazar</a>) and I decided to go on the first Thursday of June. In the days before we went, I tried to nervously pin down the strumming patterns for my songs. The first song, Ms. Missing You, was mostly done, but the strumming pattern for the second one, (Charlie) Chaplin, had eluded me ever since the song's birth. I managed to finish the strumming patterns on the day before the event because...procrastination! :D
            <br><br>
            The event started 30 minutes late because we waited for more people to sign up. A few people performed before I did, including my friends. This puzzled us because I had been the second person to sign up for the open mic, but I didn't mind since it let me burn through my nerves.
            <br><br>
            When it was finally my turn, my limbs went cold and my hands were trembling a bit HAHAHA. I ended up borrowing Cristeen's guitar because it had a plug for the amp (<b>cough</b> more fancy than mine). When I got onstage, the 22 Tango Records people helped me do a small soundcheck, which gave me time to gather my wits.
            <br><br>
            For those of you who are going to watch the videos of my performance, I'm sorry for the intro to Ms. Missing You. I can't bear to watch it. Also, you may notice that I mostly looked downwards or at the guitar. That's because I have stage fright and it gets worse when I have to look out at the crowd. I know that's bad for stage presence, so I'm working on it. At least I was able to perform well this time! Let's not ever think about my previous open mic.
            <br><br>
            I also have a few notes on my performances. Ms. Missing You did not go as well as expected. Since I've played it more times than (Charlie) Chaplin, I didn't practice it as much. That was probably why it didn't go so well haha. It was also the first song I performed, so I was still quite nervous. However, I'm glad I messed that up and not Chaplin, because Chaplin could be messed up much worse (I mean, it's totally not my favorite or anything).
            <br><br>
            For (Charlie) Chaplin, it actually went better than expected, probably because of less nerves and I worked on it more. Admittedly I did go slightly flat at some points because I was holding back, afraid my voice might crack haha. But still, that performance was better than the recording I have on SoundCloud, which I'm planning to redo someday.
            <br><br>
            In the end, my songs weren't chosen for the Democrazy volume, which showcases 22 Tango Records' favorite performances, but I'm still glad I went. I mean, I'd be more proud of myself if I <i>had</i> gotten in, but I'm really proud that I got the guts to actually go and perform my songs. Maybe next time will be the charm :)

            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ee3GKmxFiE">Smile by Cristeen Salazar</a> (not the Democrazy Live performance, as there was no video for that, but still the same song)
            <br>
            and last but not least, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/22tangorecords/alexandrea-mae-alix-give-in-to-me?in=22tangorecords/sets/demo-crazy-vol-6">Give In To Me by Alexandrea Alix</a>, another friend who performed but not on the same day as I did.

            It's really unbelievable how many people got behind my story and carried it all the way to the 3rd place. (When it came to votes, let's be honest, 1st and 2nd were only competing with each other XD)

            Congratulations to my fellow writers whose stories also got chosen! I'm honored to be included with all of you.
            <br><br>
            Thank you, also, to @8lettersbooks for giving me the honor to be in their Top 10! This contest has been quite a journey for me and I have grown from it.
