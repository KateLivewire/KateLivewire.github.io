            <p style="text-align:left;">
              I started writing this song a few years ago, and as soon as I came up with the first two lines, I immediately thought of two strangers who happen to meet and fall in love.
            </p>
            <br>
            <i>you say you like the way I talk
            <br>I say I like the way your accent lilts</i>
            <br><br>
            <p style="text-align:left;">
              I shelved the idea,  however, because I didn't know the right guitar chords for it . . . and also because I really forgot about it entirely. 
              <br><br>Then last year, around the time the quarantine started, I remembered the song and I decided it was finally time to finish it. 
              After all, it had had several years to ferment - I figured it was time to finally start working on it.
              <br><br> But as I developed the song, the story started to change. 
              Instead of the meet-cute I had originally envisioned, the song turned into more of a best-friends-turned-lovers type of story (I have a soft spot for that kind of romance alright).
              So, I took that idea and ran with it. 
              I imagined two people who used to be extremely close in their teens, fell out of touch during their college years, then reconnected and fell in love when they were older and more mature.
              Two people who knew each other's ins and outs, and yet had more to discover in their relationship. 
              <br><br> Call me a sucker, but I've always loved romance - especially romance where their love is based on a deep understanding of each other, and not just on a whim. 
              I wanted this song to be happy and sweet, just like the moment where you finally find the person you want to share your life with. 
              And, well, considering my tendency to write dark songs, I thought this would be a nice change.
              <br><br> But that's not the end of the story!
              Just a few months after I finished this song, I had the chance to premiere it at Developh's Festival, which raised funds for students in need and gave a platform to student creatives.
              Since it was all hosted online, I decided to make lyric videos for my songs and leave the streaming in Developh's hands - which really came in handy because I literally missed half of my set on the day itself!
              <br><br> Although this song was a long time in the making, it has given me so much: the experience of my first online gig, the confidence to sing original riffs (baby steps!), and a song that I can sing when I feel like being cheesy and romantic (finally, something happy, am I right?). 
              <br><br> I hope that you enjoy the song as much as I do, and any likes, comments, or shares would really make my day!
