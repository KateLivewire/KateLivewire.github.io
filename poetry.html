            <br>
            <p style="text-align:left;">
            Pale moonlight gets trapped,
            <br>
            in my fingers,
            <br>
            where I'm at
            <br>
            right now.
            <br>
            Smoothing over worries in my head,
            <br>
            trying to rid of this over thinking.
            <br>
            Loving every second,
            <br>
            craving more,
            <br>
            oh how I adore all these memories
            <br>
            we make.
            <br>
            Singing a lullaby.
            <br>
            Brushing over bare skin.
            <br>
            Cradling me when I need help.
            <br>
            Watching me give in.
            <br>
            Waves sing me to sleep.
            <br>
            Your eyes are to keep our memories
            <br>
            safe in these treasured halls
            <br>
            of mine.
            <br>
            Soft sand against your burning skin.
            <br>
            Watching every drop sink in
            <br>
            this pool
            <br>
            of never ending wonder.
            <br>
            And am I a fool to say
            <br>
            that this is heaven?

            <h3>The Most Beautiful Way</h3>
            <hr>
            <br>
            <p style="text-align:left;">
            I think the most beautiful way a person can break your heart
            <br>
            Is when they come at the right time
            <br>
            Just before you crack
            <br>
            And they build you up and put you back together
            <br>
            Fill you with the warmest feelings and envelop you in safety
            <br>
            Then they use pieces of themselves to glue your broken pieces
            <br>
            Making the most resilient heart you'll ever have
            <br>
            And you give them all you can from your recovering soul
            <br>
            But they leave
            <br>
            Not because of you
            <br>
            Because of them
            <br>
            And as time passes, your heart aches more and more
            <br>
            With perfect memories and dreams that never were
            <br>
            Instead of leaving you in pieces, they leave you whole
            <br>
            And your heart throbs with pain
            <br>
            Because you'd rather be broken again and have them fix you
            <br>
            Than be whole and live without them.

            <h3>Skipping Stone</h3>
            <hr>
            <br>
            <p style="text-align:left;">
              A skipping stone is a wish.
              <br>
              A wish once meant to be true.
              <br>
              Say a prayer over it and throw
              <br>
              it onto the deep blue.
              <br>
              Water is sweet,
              <br>
              soft and hard
              <br>
              and good.
              <br>
              Healing your skin and breaking your bones.
              <br>
              Float on your back and swish.
              <br>
              Swish
              <br>
              Swish
              <br>
              The water ripples around you,
              <br>
              the sound is beautiful.
              <br>
              Your ears hear tiny tiny bubbling
              <br>
              sounds, coming into your head.
              <br>
              It feels cool against your skin.
              <br>
              Lovely soft lips caress your every move.
              <br>
              The wind whips over the pale blue moon.
              <br>
              Dark and deep
              <br>
              with secrets to keep,
              <br>
              the ocean is a deep dark blue.
              <br>
              Will it keep my secrets too?
              <br>
              I whisper in the night,
              <br>
              tell of all my frights.
              <br>
              My hopes and dreams and evermore.
              <br>
              When done I settle back to watch
              <br>
              birds over flying
              <br>
              back in flocks.
              <br>
              Then a surprise.
              <br>
              The ocean whispers back to me.
              <br>
              I understand your troubles, see,
              <br>
              I once was the spirit of a skipping stone,
              <br>
              my only wish, to find a home.
              <br>
              An airy home with lots of space,
              <br>
              love and people
              <br>
              full of grace.
              <br>
              Now I am the ocean sea and pond.
              <br>
              Fishes swim and are my constants.
              <br>
              My dreams came true and I'm content.
              <br>
              And if that can all come from one skipping stone
              <br>
              what can YOU do

            I'm Kate Livewire, a poet who strangely hasn't read much poetry so far. I'm working on that, don't worry.
            <br>
            I write a lot of freestyle and haiku, and all the poems posted here are my original works.
