            <p style="text-align:left;">
            people pass, a breeze ruffles the grass around my feet and fresh wind blows in my face.
            <br><br>
            you sit there, seemingly normal except for your eyes.
            <br><br>
            your beautiful eyes...
            <br><br>
            today's the day, my dove.
            <br><br>
            my Colm.
            <br><br>
            <br><br>
            they said that you can hear us, if a bit faintly.
            <br><br>
            back then i thought, you poor thing.
            <br><br>
            <br><br>
            you must think you're going crazy.
            <br><br>
            talking to us, with no one there.
            <br><br>
            <br><br>
            <br><br>
            <br><br>
            they make fun of you.
            <br><br>
            "says he can talk to ghosts. belongs in the loony bin that one."
            <br><br>
            <br><br>
            bullied, with no way to defend yourself.
            <br><br>
            <br><br>
            all you see is shadows, after all.
            <br><br>
            our souls.
            <br><br>
            they say you're blind, when you're actually quite the opposite.
            <br><br>
            you're enlightened.
            <br><br>
            <br><br>
            <br><br>
            <br><br>
            i think you like me, now.
            <br><br>
            you ignore most of the other ghosts, after all.
            <br><br>
            yet you talk to me.
            <br><br>
            <br><br>
            you say you like my laugh.
            <br><br>
            that it's musical.
            <br><br>
            you're such a poet.
            <br><br>
            whoever marries you in the end will be so lucky.
            <br><br>
            <br><br>
            <br><br>
            <br><br>
            i've told you again and again that i'm not real.
            <br><br>
            not alive.
            <br><br>
            but you won't listen.
            <br><br>
            you keep insisting that this is enough for you.
            <br><br>
            no need for human contact, kisses, and so on.
            <br><br>
            <br><br>
            <br><br>
            <br><br>
            but you don't understand.
            <br><br>
            i'll be passing on soon.
            <br><br>
            to the next world.
            <br><br>
            maybe we'll meet again there.
            <br><br>
            <br><br>
            <br><br>
            <br><br>
            so this is my goodbye, you darling boy-man.
            <br><br>
            i am not a poet like you, but i hope i made you understand.
            <br><br>
            <br><br>
            and before i go, just remember that i love you.
            <br><br>
            i really do.
            <br><br>
            it feels strange saying it, since i've never really loved anyone in my living lifeâ€”-or dead life, for that matter.
            <br><br>
            but you made me love.
            <br><br>
            even with my unbeating heart, you taught me how it feels to love someone and be loved back.
            <br><br>
            so for that, thank you.
            <br><br>
            thank you so much.
            <br><br>
            <br><br>

            and with that, she kissed him on his tender, virgin lips, and for the first and last time, they were able to feel one another.
            <br><br>
            he opened his cloudy eyes and smiled as he watched her slowly fade away, into the next life . . .
